**AIM OF  JOHNSON COUNTER:**

The aim of the Johnson counter (also known as a twisted ring counter) is to generate a unique sequence of bit patterns by circulating and inverting the bits in a shift register. 

**It is commonly used in digital systems for applications such as:** 

• Frequency division: It can divide the clock frequency by a factor of 2N, where N is the number of bits. 

• Sequence generation: Johnson counters produce predictable, distinct patterns useful in control 
systems or as counters in various applications.

• Digital pattern detection: It’s also used in specific types of synchronous counters and for 
generating timing sequences. 

By circulating and complementing the MSB (most significant bit), the Johnson counter efficiently utilizes all 2N states with fewer flip-flops than conventional counters.
